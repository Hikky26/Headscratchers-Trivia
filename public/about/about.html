            First, let's talk about the rules. You have two chances to make mistakes, so don't worry if you stumble on a tricky question. However, be strategic because your score depends on it! To earn more chances, aim for a streak of correct answers. The longer your streak, the more chances you can unlock. But beware, if you lose all your chances, it's game over, and your final score will be set.
            <br>
            Here's where it gets even more exciting. The key to achieving high scores is to maintain a streak of three or more correct answers in a row. Each consecutive correct answer will earn you bonus points, pushing your score even higher. So, keep that winning streak alive!
            <br>
            If you're truly dedicated and manage to achieve a perfect score, prepare to be rewarded handsomely with extra bonus points. The higher your score, the more bonus points you'll earn, making it an exhilarating challenge for the trivia masters out there.
